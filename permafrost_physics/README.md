This Jupyter Notebook is a Computational Guided Inquiry (CGI) module. In computation guided inquiry, the instructor guides the students in learning through the use of a computational tool; in this case, a Jupyter Notebook. This module is freely available under the following conditions:

1) If you would like to use this module, please contact Penny Rowe (penny@nwra.com). We would like to keep track of how many instructors are using the module. We can also provide help if needed.

2) Use implies agreement to share any modications made (e.g. through forking). We welcome comments and suggestions.

3) If the module is used in research, please acknowledge its use.


Instructions for use:

Students will need the *.ipynb files in this folder as well as the supporting material in the "materials" folder except for the file

Borehole_740-Nome__TBA_-Dataset_1125-Constant_Over_Interval-Annually-Ground_Temperature-Unknown.timeserie.csv

which students will download as part of the activity. We recommend having a copy of the file on hand (e.g. on a thumb drive) in case students have any trouble downloading the data, since it is not possible to complete the module without this file.

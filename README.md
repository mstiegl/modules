# Polar-CGI
Computational Guided Inquiry modules for polar research and data

These Jupyter Notebooks are Computational Guided Inquiry (CGI) modules. In computational guided inquiry, the instructor guides the students in learning through the use of a computational tool; in this case, a Jupyter Notebook. This module is freely available under the following conditions:

1) If you would like to use this module, please contact Penny Rowe (prowe@nwra.com). We would like to keep track of how many instructors are using the module. We can also provide help if needed.

2) Use implies agreement to share any modications made (e.g. through forking). We welcome comments and suggestions.

3) If the module is used in research, please acknowledge its use.


Running the code:  
These can be run with Jupyter Notebook. However, a number of ancillary files are needed which we haven't provided yet. Instead, please contact us directly if you would like to try out or teach a module.

Viewing the code:  
You can see a view-only version by going into a folder and clicking on files with the extension .pynb. Sometimes this fails for unknown reasons. (You see a spinning wheel with a cat and after a long time it asks if you want to reload). In this case, there is another option. Open a new browser tab and navigate to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. There's a search window with the word "Go!" to the right. You need to click back on your tab with the Jupyter Notebook and copy the URL and paste it into that search window. Then click "Go!" and the notebook should show up.

    "Man-made, or _anthropogenic_ climate change is leading to warming of Earth's average global temepratures. The polar regions are particularly sensitive to warming for a variety of reasons. Chief among these is the _ice-albedo feedback_. Ice is highly reflective, reflecting about 80% of the sunglight that hits it. This reflectivity is referred to as _albedo_, and the fact that ice has a high albedo helps keep it cool. As anthropogenic warming causes sea ice melt, the underlying ocean is exposed. The albedo of the ocean is quite low, and the ocean absorbs 90% of the sunlight hitting it. Thus, the more sea ice melts, the more sunlight is absorbed, further accelerating warming. A process such as this is known as a _positive feedback_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arctic sea ice extent varies over the course of each year, reaching a minimum in September. Measured in September, Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13.3% per decade, with serious consequences for people and animals. Perhaps the most well-known negative consequence is the reduction in habitat for polar bears, who rely on sea ice for hunting. However, there are a variety of other impacts, including sea level rise, changes in ocean circulation, changes in winter weather patterns, melting of permafrost, damage to Arctic habitat, and the opening of the NorthWest passage. \n"

    "The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument is part of NASA's Earth Observing System. MODIS instruments on two satellites image the entire Earth every 1 to 2 days. MODIS has a _viewing swath_ width of 2,330 km, imaging Earth at 3 spatial resolutions, in 36 spectral bands. These spectral bands include 645, 555, and 469 nanometers, corresponding to red, green, and blue light, allowing the creation of color images such as our eyes see. The other spectral bands include the thermal infrared. As part of the pre-class activities, read about MODIS here: https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/ and here: https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/media/modis_brochure.pdf. \n",
